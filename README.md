My weather app using a weather API.

## 1. Worflow

The first thing I did was do a wireframe off of the image we were given in class. I then went to Bulma to start getting elements to make up my page.

After I had my HTML wireframe in place, I started to pseudocode my JS. For me, being able to see my wireframe gives me a better understanding of how to read the given README file. With that in place, I added a .gitignore file to my repo because I have been having issues with files showing up in my repo that I don't want.

My next step was to write the code that would call on the Weather API to get the weather data. I was able to easily able to get my call working. However, I ran into issues getting the buttons to render as well as have the right data show up. I worked on my code with my tutor and was able to get my city button to render from my search and the right data to show up. I worked on making sure my day forecast was good and moved on to finishing my code.
