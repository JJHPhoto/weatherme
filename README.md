# weatherme

My weather app using a weather API.

## 1. Worflow

The first thing I did was do a wireframe off of the image we were given in class. I then went to Bulma to start getting elements to make up my page.

After I had my HTML wireframe in place, I started to pseudocode my JS. For me, being able to see my wireframe gives me a better understanding of how to read the given README file. With that in place, I added a .gitignore file to my repo because I have been having issues with files showing up in my repo that I don't want.
